Domain Model
 
Figure 2: Domain Model (Domain model.png)
Figure 2 Description
Figure 2 represents the domain model for the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. Starting with an abstract User class that specializes into Student, Instructor, and Administrator reflecting the main actors and roles from the problem statement and business requirements. Students enroll in Courses through Enrollment association while Instructors teach and manage the Courses. Each Course is organized into one or more Course Modules representing the lessons or modules within the course. Each Course will be linked to ReferenceMaterial representing things like textbooks, videos, readings, and other resources. 
The system supports formal, graded assessments through the Assessments and Question classes. Assessments can be composed of multiple Questions with a Course containing one or more Assessments. Student performance on graded Assessments is captured via the Attempt class linking the Student to a specific Assessment with a recorded outcome. Learning goals inside of Assessments and other content the domain includes a Concept class to represent the key topics or skills in the course. Both CourseModules and Questions contain Concepts allowing the system to analyze where a student may be lacking understanding.
The adaptive learning behavior is represented through PracticeSession and PracticeQuestion. A PracticeSession are the personalized practice activities initiated by students while PracticeQuestions are the generated Questions presented to the student and whether they were answered correctly. PracticeQuestions are tied back to Question so that the adaptive engine can reuse question templates relating them to Concepts for the Student. As the Student takes more and more PracticeQuestions their understanding of the concept is show via the StudentConceptMastery class. Using the mastery students can view where they are struggling and their progress in learning those concepts.  
 
Domain Class
 
Figure 3: Domain Class (Domain Class diagram.png)
Domain Class Description
Figure 3 shows the class diagram of the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. This diagram iterates from the previous by introducing attributes and operations with a separation of the domain and service layers. The class diagram unlike the domain diagram will show how the system behaves and which classes own different pieces of logic.
The domain layer defines core behaviors with attributes. Student includes operations for RequestPractice() and viewProgress() showing how they are the intiator of adaptive practice flows. Course and CourseModule have additions like addModule() and addReferenceMaterial() displaying how they maintain their own internal structure. Assessment and Question both include operations for addQuestion() and validateAnswer() allowing these classes to manage the questions while validating them inside the same logic. In the Adaptive practice classes they have PracticeSession to add practice questions while determining a score. StudentConceptMastery will include a updateLevel that adjusts the mastery of a student based on updated values from PracticeSession and Questions.
Whats new in this diagram is the service layer containing classes such as: UserService, CourseService, AssessmentService, and AdaptivePracticeService. These show application-level workflows that work with multiple domain objects. As an example AdaptivePracticceService provides generatePracticeSession() and updateMastery() that centralizes logic for student performance and practice results. AssessmentService handles submission and scoring of attempts on tests, quizzes, and general assignments. CourseService on the other hand manages the enrollment and progress calculations for the class. 

Design Patterns
GRASP
Controller
The service layer classes will act as the GRASP controllers handling system events from the UI. The adaptive practice service will control flows like the request practice session and submit practice answer. Course Service enables enrollment in courses while allowing queries for progress in those courses. Assessment service takes the questions answered by students submitting them for review then scoring them for graded assessments. These services delegate complex logic to specific controller classes while keeping the Web UI simple. Doing so improves testability and reuse of servies.
Information Expert
Responsibilities are delegated to the classes with the most relevant data:
Practice Session knows the list of Practice Question objects allowing it to implement calculateScore() and hasNext(). Assessment has its own list of Question Objects via addQuestion(). StudentConceptMastery holds information about each concept while updating updateLevel() for the student as they take practice sessions or graded assignments. Thesemethods mean logic is kept close to the data it operates on reducing any duplication while making the design easier to maintain.
Low Coupling & High Cohesion
The system gets divided into several cohesive components:
The domain layer (Course, Assessment, PracticeSession) focuses on the business concepts of a online learning platform. The service layer (AdaptivePracticeService, CourseService, AssessmentService) focus on application workflows. Separating each layer keeps classes focused on a single process (high cohesion) while minimizing dependencies between unrelated parts of the system (low coupling).
SOLID
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Every major class and component should have one primary reason to change. AdaptivePracticeService does not handle authentication, course management, or enrollment. It is only responsible for adaptive practice workflows. CourseService handles all course related operations like adding media, assessments, grades. AssessmentService focuses on the assessments itself like taking them, grading them, or changing due dates for them. Domain classes like PracticeSession and Assessment handle one specific concept. Keeping the focus on one reason to change reduces risk of changes causing changes and so on while simplifying maintenance on each class and component.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
This principle allows for extension without modification of existing code. Assessment or Question can be extended with new types of assessments or questions while keeping existing clients unchanged. This can be done by adding to the existing list for object/class. The AdaptivePracticeService can be configured to use a different AI provider via changing the API called or services. The UI in this case would remain completely unchanged as the user, student, would see no change. 
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This principle involves using a inheritance hierarchy which can be view via different classes. Student, Administrator, and Instructor extend the abstract User class to be treated as User wherever authentication or generic user operations are used. Shared behavior like login or logout is defined in specific classes in this case User allows for the behavior to be defined one but called in multiple areas of the system. In the case of roles subclasses can add behavior for those specific roles without breaking expectations.
GoF Design Patterns
Façade
Façade pattern involves providing a simplified interface to more complex systems for ease of use. An example of this is the AdaptivePracticeService where the user will not see it retrieving course progress, assessment history, concept mastery, or calling external AI services. On the UI side a single call (RequestPractice() for example) triggers all the needed operations and privdes the output directly to the users.
Strategy
Strategy patters define a group of algorithms to allow them to be switched as needed while the program needs them. The adaptive behavior can be designed with strategies. When it needs to select weak concepts, choosing question difficulty based on mastery, or updating the mastery itself. These can be shown as MasteryUpdateStrategy or QuestionSelectionStrategy that can be reference by the AdaptivePracticeService. Using these strategies makes the system easier to tune as new approaches are introduced into the system. 
Observer
These patterns establish a relationship where one object is watched by several others. This can be seen by the AdaptivePracticeService. Students view the practice service as it generates practice sessions and questions for them to answer. The instructor views this service by providing explanations and editing of questions generated by the service. 
Microservice and Architectural Patterns
Layered Architecture
The system is broken in multiple distinct layers to simplify reasoning about the system. This improves separation of concern while making future refactoring easier. The Presentation layer handles user interaction via the Web UI (frontend). Application layer is the implementation of the use cases. This involves service components like Auth and User management, course and content, and assessment. The Data layer is where the LMS and Analytics lives storing persistent states. Finally, the External Services layer is how the system connects to Azure Open AI, Azure communication services, and Azure Active Directory. 
Service Decomposition/Potential Microservices
The application layer is divided into services that align with different business goals. Those specific services are: Auth and User Management, Course and Content, Assessment, Adaptive Practice, and Analytics. Each of these services can be deployed individually as a microservice with its own API and data store. All of these work behind a unified web UI. The design supports scalability and individual deployment. This provides a safe rollback method if any particular service has any issues during deployment.
Link to UML Diagrams 
GRASP Link
In the Use Case Diagrams several of the users are mapped to the controller classes shown in the Class Diagram. The Classes are where the Service Layer components act as GRASP controllers when initiated by the users (actors). PracticeSession and Assessment own the attributes to run their own behaviors showing the Information Expert clearly in the Class Diagram. This is further shown via the Sequence Diagrams where objects receiving messages are the same ones holding the relevant data. The Component Diagram shows boundaries between responsibilities displaying the low coupling in GRASP.
SOLID Links
Class Diagrams show Single Responsibility through the separation of Domain Classes from Service Classes. The Open/Closes Principle is shown in the way certain objects can be extended without modifying existing classes. This is most seen in the class and component designs like Assessment and AI strategies. Substitutability is shown in the Sequence Diagrams where user types (student, instructor) are all treated with an abstract class called User (Liskov Substitution Principle). 
GoF Links
In the Sequence Diagram the AdaptivePracticeService encapsulates a complex interaction presenting a simplified interface to the web UI is a great example of Façade Pattern. In the Class Diagram the adaptive learning logic (Question selection, master updates, explanations) can be encapsulated outside of the AdaptivePracticeService for varying behaviors showcasing Strategy Patterns. The Component Diagram implies a Repository-like structure through distinct database components despite being shown conceptually in the diagrams. 
Architectural Links
Architecture and Microservice patterns appear most frequently in the Component and Deployment Diagrams. The flow of components between browser, web app, backend, databases, and external services clearly represents layered separation. Microservice best practices are shown by grouping related responsibilities into the same components. Examples of this would be Course Management, Assessment Management or Adaptive Practice which all still support monolithic or modular deployments as shown in the Azure Diagram.
