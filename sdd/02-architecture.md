Figure 2 Description
Figure 2 represents the domain model for the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. Starting with an abstract User class that specializes into Student, Instructor, and Administrator reflecting the main actors and roles from the problem statement and business requirements. Students enroll in Courses through Enrollment association while Instructors teach and manage the Courses. Each Course is organized into one or more Course Modules representing the lessons or modules within the course. Each Course will be linked to ReferenceMaterial representing things like textbooks, videos, readings, and other resources. 
The system supports formal, graded assessments through the Assessments and Question classes. Assessments can be composed of multiple Questions with a Course containing one or more Assessments. Student performance on graded Assessments is captured via the Attempt class linking the Student to a specific Assessment with a recorded outcome. Learning goals inside of Assessments and other content the domain includes a Concept class to represent the key topics or skills in the course. Both CourseModules and Questions contain Concepts allowing the system to analyze where a student may be lacking understanding.
The adaptive learning behavior is represented through PracticeSession and PracticeQuestion. A PracticeSession are the personalized practice activities initiated by students while PracticeQuestions are the generated Questions presented to the student and whether they were answered correctly. PracticeQuestions are tied back to Question so that the adaptive engine can reuse question templates relating them to Concepts for the Student. As the Student takes more and more PracticeQuestions their understanding of the concept is show via the StudentConceptMastery class. Using the mastery students can view where they are struggling and their progress in learning those concepts.

Domain Class Description
Figure 3 shows the class diagram of the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. This diagram iterates from the previous by introducing attributes and operations with a separation of the domain and service layers. The class diagram unlike the domain diagram will show how the system behaves and which classes own different pieces of logic.
The domain layer defines core behaviors with attributes. Student includes operations for RequestPractice() and viewProgress() showing how they are the intiator of adaptive practice flows. Course and CourseModule have additions like addModule() and addReferenceMaterial() displaying how they maintain their own internal structure. Assessment and Question both include operations for addQuestion() and validateAnswer() allowing these classes to manage the questions while validating them inside the same logic. In the Adaptive practice classes they have PracticeSession to add practice questions while determining a score. StudentConceptMastery will include a updateLevel that adjusts the mastery of a student based on updated values from PracticeSession and Questions.
Whats new in this diagram is the service layer containing classes such as: UserService, CourseService, AssessmentService, and AdaptivePracticeService. These show application-level workflows that work with multiple domain objects. As an example AdaptivePracticceService provides generatePracticeSession() and updateMastery() that centralizes logic for student performance and practice results. AssessmentService handles submission and scoring of attempts on tests, quizzes, and general assignments. CourseService on the other hand manages the enrollment and progress calculations for the class.
