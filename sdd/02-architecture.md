USE Case Diagram
 
Figure 1: Use Case Diagram – Online Learning Platform with Adaptive Practice (Use Case Diagram.png)
Figure 1 Description
Figure 1 displays all the major actors in the system with functional interactions for each. The three primary actors that interact with the system are: Students, Instructors, and Administrators. Students can access course content, view grades and instructor feedback, and take assessments. If needed they can request adaptive practice sessions to then take ai generated practice content. Instructors manage course content and assessments while viewing student performance and struggle areas. They are also able to use analytics to review adaptive practice information. Administrators on the other hand manage users and assign roles that determine what content they can view. They are able to edit and create new courses in the catalog while adding or removing content for those courses. System wide settings for the adaptive Practice AI system are configured by the Administrators.

An external AI practice service generates personalized practice questions with related explanations based on the student performance data. The students can view these explanations while taking practice quizzes and tests. As the generated practice material is made separately from the main course content this ensures the adaptive practice results do not alter the students grades. The Take AI generated material use case includes a dependency on Generate practice questions and explanations indicating dynamically created content rather than pre made ones. Having view explanations as a necessary next step after taking practice assessments reinforces learning by seeing the explanations for incorrect responses.

Domain Model
 
Figure 2: Domain Model (Domain model.png)
Figure 2 Description
Figure 2 represents the domain model for the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. Starting with an abstract User class that specializes into Student, Instructor, and Administrator reflecting the main actors and roles from the problem statement and business requirements. Students enroll in Courses through Enrollment association while Instructors teach and manage the Courses. Each Course is organized into one or more Course Modules representing the lessons or modules within the course. Each Course will be linked to ReferenceMaterial representing things like textbooks, videos, readings, and other resources. 
The system supports formal, graded assessments through the Assessments and Question classes. Assessments can be composed of multiple Questions with a Course containing one or more Assessments. Student performance on graded Assessments is captured via the Attempt class linking the Student to a specific Assessment with a recorded outcome. Learning goals inside of Assessments and other content the domain includes a Concept class to represent the key topics or skills in the course. Both CourseModules and Questions contain Concepts allowing the system to analyze where a student may be lacking understanding.
The adaptive learning behavior is represented through PracticeSession and PracticeQuestion. A PracticeSession are the personalized practice activities initiated by students while PracticeQuestions are the generated Questions presented to the student and whether they were answered correctly. PracticeQuestions are tied back to Question so that the adaptive engine can reuse question templates relating them to Concepts for the Student. As the Student takes more and more PracticeQuestions their understanding of the concept is show via the StudentConceptMastery class. Using the mastery students can view where they are struggling and their progress in learning those concepts.  
 
Domain Class
 
Figure 3: Domain Class (Domain Class diagram.png)
Domain Class Description
Figure 3 shows the class diagram of the online learning platform with adaptive practice support. This diagram iterates from the previous by introducing attributes and operations with a separation of the domain and service layers. The class diagram unlike the domain diagram will show how the system behaves and which classes own different pieces of logic.
The domain layer defines core behaviors with attributes. Student includes operations for RequestPractice() and viewProgress() showing how they are the intiator of adaptive practice flows. Course and CourseModule have additions like addModule() and addReferenceMaterial() displaying how they maintain their own internal structure. Assessment and Question both include operations for addQuestion() and validateAnswer() allowing these classes to manage the questions while validating them inside the same logic. In the Adaptive practice classes they have PracticeSession to add practice questions while determining a score. StudentConceptMastery will include a updateLevel that adjusts the mastery of a student based on updated values from PracticeSession and Questions.
Whats new in this diagram is the service layer containing classes such as: UserService, CourseService, AssessmentService, and AdaptivePracticeService. These show application-level workflows that work with multiple domain objects. As an example AdaptivePracticceService provides generatePracticeSession() and updateMastery() that centralizes logic for student performance and practice results. AssessmentService handles submission and scoring of attempts on tests, quizzes, and general assignments. CourseService on the other hand manages the enrollment and progress calculations for the class.
