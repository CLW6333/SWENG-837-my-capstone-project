Context

 - The system requires an adaptive learning component to support students struggling with specific concepts.

 - Two major approaches were considered:

  - - Adjusting the difficulty of course content dynamically (“adaptive difficulty”)

 - - Generating personalized practice quizzes and explanations using AI (“adaptive practice generation”)

 - The system must remain aligned with instructor-created content and avoid altering core course materials.

 - The platform must support scalable, automated creation of personalized learning resources without extensive instructor workload.

 - The adaptive feature must help students understand why they are struggling, not simply increase or decrease difficulty levels.

 - Educational institutions require clear separation between official graded assessments and supplemental practice material.

Decision

 - The system will use AI-generated personalized practice quizzes and explanations instead of adaptive difficulty adjustments.

 - The AI engine will analyze student performance, identify weak concepts, and create targeted practice activities.

 - The AI generation will use only instructor-approved content and course materials.

 - Official graded assessments will not be modified or replaced by AI.


Rationale

 - Adaptive difficulty alters the instructional pathway, which could conflict with instructor-designed learning outcomes and accreditation requirements.

 - AI-generated practice supports students without changing core course structure or pacing.

 - Instructors maintain full control over official content while still benefiting from automation for supplemental study resources.

 - Generating practice questions allows finer granularity of feedback, helping students understand mistakes rather than simply facing harder/easier questions.

 - AI generation is significantly more scalable than instructor-written individualized study material.

This approach aligns with LMS expectations: practice can be adaptive, while assignments remain static.


Consequences

Positive:

 - Students receive highly personalized practice without changing course design.

 - Instructors retain full authority over course content and grading standards.

 - AI reduces instructor workload for supplemental resources.

 - System remains compliant with academic and accreditation constraints.

 - Simpler to ensure AI explanations reference correct, instructor-approved materials.

Negative:

 - Requires reliable AI service integration and cloud compute capacity.

 - Must validate AI outputs for correctness and alignment.

 - Students may expect adaptive difficulty and must be educated on the difference.
