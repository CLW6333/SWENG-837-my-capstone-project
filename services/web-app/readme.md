 Web App Service

 Purpose

The Web App Service provides the user-facing interface for the Online Learning Platform with Adaptive Practice. It allows students, instructors, and administrators to interact with the system through a responsive web application.

The Web App does not contain business logic or data processing. Instead, it communicates with the API Service for all backend operations and displays results to users. This separation follows the layered architecture described in the SDD.

 Responsibilities

- Render UI pages for students, instructors, and administrators
- Manage authentication and route users through Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)
- Display course content, assignments, grades, and adaptive practice options
- Present adaptive practice sessions generated by the AI Service (via the API Service)
- Show immediate feedback and references for incorrect answers
- Provide dashboards for student progress and instructor analytics
- Ensure responsive, accessible user experience across devices

 Interaction With Other Services

 API Service
The Web App calls the API Service for:
- Retrieving course and enrollment data
- Fetching and submitting graded work
- Initiating or retrieving adaptive practice sessions
- Recording student performance
- Displaying analytics dashboards

All communication occurs through secured HTTPS calls using REST endpoints defined in `specs/openapi.yaml`.

 AI Service
The Web App never communicates directly with the AI Service.

Instead:
- The Web App sends requests to the API Service.
- The API Service orchestrates communication with the AI Service.
- The Web App displays AI-generated questions, explanations, and references returned by the API.

This separation ensures proper security boundaries and maintains the layered architecture.

 Azure Active Directory
- Handles login and identity tokens
- Provides role-based authorization (student/instructor/admin)
- Ensures secure and verified access before interacting with the API

 Architectural Justification

The Web App is separated from backend logic to support:
- Maintainability via clear separation of concerns
- Independent scaling of front-end and back-end services
- Increased security by ensuring no direct access to databases or AI models
- Reduced complexity of client code
- Clean alignment with GRASP and SOLID principles

 Technology Stack (Hypothetical)

While implementation is out of scope for this project, a typical technology stack might include:

- React or Angular for the UI
- Azure App Service for hosting
- Azure AD for identity and authentication
- HTTPS/REST communication with API Service

 Folder Purpose

This folder documents the role and responsibilities of the Web App Service. It does not contain executable code, as the capstone focuses on software design rather than implementation.
